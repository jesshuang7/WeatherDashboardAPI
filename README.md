## About the Project:
The focus of this project was to use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. The dashboard will display the current weather of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, which will be color coded upon dangerness. It will also display the five-day forecast with its date, temperature, weather icon, humidity. The search history will be added as buttons to retreive history.
